## Schedule (1 cup of food for each dog/meal)
```
9:30am - breakfast
11:30am - Ruby's pill
12:30pm - lunch
6:30pm - dinner
11:30pm - Ruby's pill
```
- Thoroughly rinse bowls with hot water (set nozzle to spray mode to blast off any old food remnants)
- Leave enough water in the bottom to cover the base of the bowl, this will absorb into the food and helps a bit with digestion
- Add 3 pumps of supplement during breakfast / dinner meals (do not include any supplements for lunch)
- Each girl gets 1 cup of food per meal (there is a metal cup measuring scooper in the 
- Shake bowl to stir in water and let stand for 30 seconds before setting down

## Medication
![Example](https://github.com/pynacl/assets/blob/main/IMG_8260.jpg)
Ruby gets 1 pill every 12 hours as listed above. It's very important to not mistakenly give the pill to Honey by accident as it can cause major cardiac issues.
1. Grab one pill pouch treat and rip in half
2. Jam the pill into one half and squeeze it shut
3. Give the pill containing half to **RUBY**, ensuring she swallows it
4. Give other non pill half to **HONEY**

## Outside
They normally go outside right before breakfast at 9:30am, and then again 30min after eating. After that they normally are outside every hour or so. You're welcome to leave the back sliding door completely open if it's nice out, or just let them in whenever they come back to the door. Try your best to prevent Ruby from digging holes, but if she does the easiest way to clean her is the hose out back.

## Things to know
They will both bark and go insane at virtually _every_ person and dog that goes by. I normally tune them out unless they jump at the windows.
