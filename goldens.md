# Honey and Ruby
Quick doggo reference guide for watching the gals

## Schedule
```
9:30am - breakfast
11:30am - Ruby's pill
12:30pm - lunch
6:30pm - dinner
11:30pm - Ruby's pill
```

## Food
_Note: Honey's bowl is near the door, Ruby's under the counter_
- 1 cup of food for each dog/meal
- clean bowls with hot water before each meal and leave a small amout of water in the bowl (this absorbs into the food and helps a bit with digestion)
- (Breakfast / Dinner only): Add 3 pumps of joint supplement (brown glass bottle in pantry)

## Medication
_Ruby gets 1 pill every 12 hours as listed above. It's very important to not mistakenly give the pill to Honey._
1. Grab one pill pouch treat and rip in half
2. Jam the pill into one half and squeeze it shut
3. Give the pill containing half to **RUBY**, ensuring she swallows it
4. Give other non pill half to **HONEY**

## Outside
They normally go outside right before breakfast at 9:30am, and then again 30min after eating. After that they normally are outside every hour or so. You're welcome to leave the back sliding door completely open if it's nice out, or just let them in whenever they come back to the door. Try your best to prevent Ruby from digging holes, but if she does the easiest way to clean her is the hose out back.

## Things to know
They will both bark and go insane at virtually _every_ person and dog that goes by. I normally tune them out unless they jump at the windows.
